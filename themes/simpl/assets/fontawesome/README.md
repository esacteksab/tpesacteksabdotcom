## Font Awesome

I didn't want to navigate the nuances of licenses and redistribution, so I'm not including these files. Start here [Host Yourself-WebFonts](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/setup/host-yourself/webfonts) on [https://docs.fontawesome.com/](https://docs.fontawesome.com/).

In `/css` I have a `main.css` and in `webfonts`, I have their fonts. You can also use a CDN. Update the templates as necessary.
