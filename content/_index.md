`tp` is a GitHub [CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) extension to create GitHub pull requests with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github) containing the output from an [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) or [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) plan's output [^1] [^2] wrapped around a `<details></details>` [elements](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections) so the plan output can be collapsed for easier reading. The body of your pull request will look like this [example](./example/EXAMPLE-PR.md) in the example directory.

## Getting Started | Installation

```bash
gh ext install esacteksab/gh-tp
```

### `.tp.toml` config file

I wanted to make as few assumptions about your environment as possible, so `tp` defines one default value `verbose = false` today. `tp` uses a config file named `.tp.toml`. This config file is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/). TOML is case-sensitive and keys are [mixedCase or camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) where applicable. It has 2 required parameters with two optional parameters. The lookup order for locating the config file is, your project's root (.e.g `.tp.toml`), `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-tp/.tp.toml`, on \*nix this is `~/.config/gh-tp`, on macOS this is `~/Library/Application Support/gh-tp`, on Windows this is `LocalAppData/gh-tp` falling back to `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and finally, we look in `$HOME/.tp.toml`.

An annotated copy exists in the [example](./example) directory. **_The config file, the parameters and possibly the presence of default values is actively being worked on. This behavior may change in a future release._**

| Parameter | Type   | Flag              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| binary    | string | `-b`,`--binary`   | N [^3]   | We look on your `$PATH` for `tofu` or `terraform`, if both exist, you _must_ define _one_ in your config or pass the flag `-b` or `--binary`. _Default: `undefined`_ |
| planFile  | string | `-o`, `--outFile` | Y        | The name of the plan's output file created by `gh tp`. _Default: `""`_                                                                                               |
| mdFile    | string | `-m`, `--mdFile`  | Y        | The name of the Markdown file created by `gh tp`. _Default: `""`_                                                                                                    |
| verbose   | bool   | `-v`, `--verbose` | N        | Enable verbose logging. _Default: `false`_                                                                                                                           |

#### `gh tp init`

You can generate a config file with `gh tp init` which is an interactive prompt with a few questions giving you the opportunity to create the file or printing to stdout so you can create the file some other way.

#### `gh tp --config`

If you'd rather not create a config file or use one of the supported paths, you can create a file anywhere you'd like named `.tp.toml` and pass `-c` or `--config` to `gh tp` with the path to that file.

```bash
gh tp --config /var/tmp/.tp.toml
✔  Plan Created...
✔  Markdown Created...
```

### Using `tp`

To create a plan and the markdown from that plan, run

```bash
gh tp
✔  Plan Created...
✔  Markdown Created...
```

Two files will be created, the first an output file named, what you defined for the value of `planFile` in `.tp.toml` config or passed with the `-o` or `--outFile` flag and a Markdown file named what you defined for the value of the parameter `mdFile` in the `.tp.toml` config file or passed to `-m` or `--mdFile` flag.

### Create Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: adding cool things"
```

### Create Pull Request with `gh`

While the end goal of this extension is to submit the pull request, that functionality doesn't exist on a public branch yet. **This feature exists in a prototype branch. It will be public _soon_!** So to submit a pull request today, we can use the built-in functionality of `gh`.

```bash
gh pr create -F plan.md
... gh things occur here ...
https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
```

### View Pull Request in Browser with `gh`

```bash
gh pr view -w
Opening https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42 in your browser.
```

### Targeting with Terraform

If you're targeting a resource, you can still create markdown from that plan's output. `tp` reads from `stdin` like so:

```bash
terraform plan -out plan.out -no-color  | gh tp -
```

Like with `gh tp` two files will exist. The first being whatever you passed to `-out` for the file name in the above example (`plan.out` in the example above) and the Markdown file named whatever you defined as the value for the `mdFile` parameter in the `.tp.toml` config file. `tp` does not create an additional plan having been passed the plan from `stdin`.

### Extended Example

The above example is intended to be just enough to get you started. If you'd like to see an example representative of a more real-world use case, one exists in the [example](./example) directory. A note though, I've been unable to figure out how to put Markdown with code fences inside Markdown code fences. So the formatting on that example exists purely out of a need to handle the situation where I output Markdown, and I'm trying to put it inside code fences. I hope you understand and I hope I can come up with a solution long-term to better display the output of `tp`.

### Disable Terminal Colors

> [!TIP]
> To disable color output in the terminal, set the environment variable `NO_COLOR` to `true`

<!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD028 -->

> [!WARNING]
> **_Pre 1.0.0 Alert_**. This is a new extension and as a result, the API isn't set yet. There have been two prototypes so far. The experiences from both have shaped what exists today, but there is still quite a bit left to do. So as I continue down the path of figuring things out, things are almost certainly going to change. **_Expect_** breaking changes in the early releases. I will _strive_ not to publish broken builds and will lean into Semver to identify `alpha`, `beta` and pre-releases.

## Motivation

I write _a lot_ of Terraform daily and a part of that process includes submitting pull requests for review by peers prior to applying the plan and merging the pull request. It can be tedious, sometimes cumbersome to run a `terraform plan -out plan.out`, copy the output from the terminal, do Git "things", open a pull request, paste the contents of the plan's output into the body of the pull request, wrap it in a code block, then wrap _that_ in a `<details></details>` block because some Terraform output can be quite lengthy and in an effort to provide a better experience and quicker access to the pull request's comments, we use the `<details></details>` mechanism to collapse the plan's output. You can use [pull request Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests) to short-circuit some of this workflow with the template already containing a pre-formatted code block wrapped in a `<details></details>` so all you have to do is paste your plan in the WYSIWYG editor and hit submit.

But ~~I'm _lazy_~~, I mean, I'm _intentional_ with the things that take my time and attention, so I dug into letting the robots do what they do best and `tp` was born! The first prototype of this was a shell script and some `sed` and `awk` leveraging existing functionality present in `gh`. I decided to continue to iterate and extend it further by writing this extension in Go.

## What tp isn't

I feel like I'm in this _weird_ space. I programmatically run a `terraform plan -out plan.out --no-color` but Terraform _already_ does that. And it's not my intent to create a wrapper around an existing tool, especially one like Terraform. I also programmatically do a `gh pr create -t $title -F file.md`, but `gh` _already_ does that. So while I find my fit in the space, I felt it was important to call out what I'm not going to do. Today, it's not uncommon for me to have to do a `-target` to plan/apply around something. `tp` doesn't natively support passing arguments to Terraform. And I don't think I want it to. So in the example of not being able to pass the `-target` argument, but still desiring to create the formatted Markdown and the subsequent pull request, `tp` can read from `stdin` so today you can run `terraform plan -target resource.name -out plan.out | gh tp -` and `tp` will create the Markdown with your plan's output.
